The optimization settings I did is to use DXT5 for graphics so that the file size will be reduced. I also used compressed the sounds to OGG so that the file size of the sounds will be reduced.

All the excess unused sound and graphics has been removed as well.

Please note that the this Endless Runner game is based on my personal project Far Field Combat Runner and this is just a minimal version of the said game that I already made on my own and the full version is on the Google Play Store.

Code is in this Git repository.

Android APK is in the build folder.

Unity version is 2022.3.17f1.
